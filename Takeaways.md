### TAKEAWAYS:
* *Page Object* methods should be named as from Business logic perspective, more abstract -
    * avoid naming methods as "clickOnSaveButton()"
    * it helps to make your test more readable and more maintainable
* Page Object returns some info about the page (e.g. new page object, text from page, a boolean result for some check, etc. -
    * never a WebElement (but there might be some exceptions - like with `searchResultElements`)
* Put explicit wait into Page Object Constructor
    * in order to wait until page ready state
    * or you can use Loadable Component pattern
* Repeating actions in multiple Page Objects should be put into separate helper class (as with Select example)
    * Make method static so that there will be no need to initialize an instance
* Recommended to return other Page Objects in a method which end up going to another page
* If a method stays on the same page, then return the same Page Object ("return this").
    * This will make your tests more "fluent" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface)
* Keep folder structure clean
* Dont hardcode data which may change with time - e.g. testing envs, test users, explicit waits, etc
    * parametrize it via external files - like config file for env URL or JSON for users data;
* More general Fixtures can be put to BaseTest class and your Test class should extend the Base Test class.
    * This way test class only has testing code without any preparation and teardown code
* DriverFactory - Hide the logic of initializing an object inside the factory
* Common methods, fields, initilization can be moved to parent Page class for all page objects
* Ensure that tests can be run in parallel in order to save time on test execution
* Run parallel tests on Selenium Grid
    * In this case - instantiate RemoteWebDriver class instead of a Browser driver concrete implementation (e.g. Chromedriver)
* Take screenshots on failures - this way it will be much easier to investigate the issues with tests
* Use informative report like Allure2
